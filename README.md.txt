**Algorithm Details:**

- Parse the decompiled code to identify all hard-coded log strings.
- Extract the class names used in the log strings. You can use regular expressions or string matching algorithms to identify class names based on common naming conventions used in the codebase.
- Create a mapping between the obfuscated class names and the identified class names based on the log strings.
- Use the mapping to rename the obfuscated class names in the decompiled code.
- Use the JEB API to update the decompiled code with the renamed class names.
- Here are some more detailed steps that you can follow:

- Use the JEB API to obtain the decompiled code for a class.
- Parse the code to identify all hard-coded log strings. You can use regular expressions or string matching algorithms to identify log strings based on common formatting patterns used in the codebase (e.g., "LOG.debug("...")").
- Extract the class names used in the log strings. You can use regular expressions or string matching algorithms to identify class names based on common naming conventions used in the codebase (e.g., "com.example.myapp.MyClass").
- Create a mapping between the obfuscated class names and the identified class names based on the log strings. For each identified class name, search the decompiled code for its obfuscated name (e.g., using a string matching algorithm or regular expression) and add it to the mapping.
- Use the mapping to rename the obfuscated class names in the decompiled code. For each mapping entry, search the decompiled code for the obfuscated class name and replace it with the identified class name.
- Use the JEB API to update the decompiled code with the renamed class names. You can use the IMethod.setBody(String) method to replace the code for each method, and the IClass.updateContent(String) method to replace the code for the entire class.
